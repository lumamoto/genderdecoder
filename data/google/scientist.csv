Research Scientist, Nursing and Patient Care Research, Operations and Practice – Relief, Day Shift.

Focus Areas: Clinical and Patient Care Research, Health Services & Health Equity Research; Biostatistics, Epidemiology & Implementation Science

About the Office of Research Patient Care Services (ORPCS)
The Office of Research in Stanford Health Care’s (SHC’s) Patient Care Services (ORPCS) conducts original research on patient care delivery and collaborates with Stanford School of Medicine researchers and SHC front-line staff on research aimed at improving patient outcomes by advancing the quality, experience, and equity of patient care. ORPCS’s 3 focus areas include: Nursing and Patient Care Services Research, Clinical Trial Facilitation, and Health Equity Research.

Nursing and Patient Care Services Research
ORPCS’s Nursing Research division focuses on investigating processes and outcomes of care delivered by front-line nurses and allied health professionals. Nurse and Research Scientists in ORPCS’s Nursing and Patient Care Services Research division help SHC front-line staff conduct research on patient care delivery and nursing practice issues identified by staff in the context of everyday patient care delivery. Nurse and Research Scientists actively guide staff on a variety of formal research practices ranging from problem definition to research design, execution, analysis, and dissemination. ORPCS’s Nursing Research division partners closely with SHC’s Nursing Excellence group to support continued professional education and advancement of front-line nursing as a critical component of SHC’s Magnet Program.

Clinical Trial Facilitation
ORPCS’s Clinical Trials division supports and facilitates sponsored clinical trials and other clinical research in partnership with Stanford University School of Medicine (SOM). The Clinical Trials division ensures nursing engagement in administrative oversight of clinical trial execution and protection of human subjects in clinical trials. Working in conjunction with a transdisciplinary team and hospital-wide stakeholders, the Clinical Trials team facilitates trial coordination across various Patient Care Services (PCS) departments and oversees execution of physician-led clinical trials and research studies originating at Stanford University’s School of Medicine. The Clinical Trials team provides trial oversight and direction involving various operational components including trial intake, review, and facilitation; study placement; staffing; training and education; budgeting and financial oversight; research integrity and patient safety; and general operational oversight.

Health Equity Research
ORPCS’s recently formed Health Equity Research division focuses on disparities-driven research with a central focus on deepening SHC’s understanding of disparities experienced by diverse racial and ethnic groups and other disproportionately impacted groups within SHC’s patient population and patient catchment areas. The Health Equity division follows a Health Equity Improvement framework that begins with Health Equity Research Scientists analyzing and visualizing health system and public data sources to reveal potential disparities in health outcomes across different racial, ethnic, and underserved subpopulations. Armed with evidence of existing disparities, Research Scientists conduct or facilitate research aimed at surfacing root causes for observed disparities, then leverage research findings and insight to inform design and implementation of tailored interventions to reduce observed disparities in measurable ways. Working synergistically with ORPCS’s Clinical Trials and Nursing and Patient Care Services Research divisions, the Health Equity division’s key focus areas include: (a) identifying and addressing health equity risks across the clinical trial life cycle with the goal of increasing diverse representation of racial and ethnic minorities in SHC clinical research, (b) identifying and addressing disparities in nurse-sensitive quality improvement, and (c) identifying and addressing health equity risks across Stanford Health Care with the goal of improving health care quality, patient-and-family experience and health outcomes.

48,8,Data Scientist,DoorDash,"San Francisco, CA",via Greenhouse,"About the Team

This role is the first of its kind on the Research team! At DoorDash, Data Scientists typically report into the Analytics function, but this role will partner with and be a fully fledged member of the Research team! You may have worked with Research partners in the past (sometimes called UX Research or Product Research), but, if not, here is what we do...

At DoorDash, researchers are a part of Product org along with product managers and designers. We define success as our ability to impact product and company strategy, particularly by driving the creation of amazing experiences for our three core audiences - Merchants, Dashers, and Customers. We employ both qualitative (e.g., ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus groups etc.) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments, eye-tracking etc.) research methods to gather data from which we then triangulate insights that inspire innovation. The Research team is at an exciting stage - growing, but still early enough where you will be able to shape the team culture and processes from the ground up, while at the same time, guiding the company to bigger and bolder new bets. This is particularly true for this role, where you will establish the foundation for the partnership between the Research and Analytics functions to inform business strategy. Your scope will be broad and your autonomy will be high.

About the Role

As a Research Data Scientist at DoorDash, you will use your quantitative background to dive into large datasets to generate insights that guide decision making. In this particular role, you will do that in partnership with the Research team. While the current team mostly specializes in methods typical of advanced social scientists, you will bring a new lens to insights discovery with your unique skill set. This role will cover all three audiences in order to allow for the greatest impact. Like our Researcher and Senior Researcher roles, your work portfolio will consist of a mix between strategic and tactical initiatives.

Here are three examples, from strategic to tactical:
• We are interested in exploring the mechanisms behind new restaurant discovery. Research shows that different types of customers are drawn to different mixes of information depending on both factors like personal interests and context. Can you help us explore deeper behavioral differences between these discovery cohorts in order to influence UX and recommendation algorithms?
• You notice an unexplainable drop off in a sign up funnel and seek out a research partner to explore why it is happening. How can you use triangulated data to inspire new product experiences that drive conversion?
• We’ve observed in qual that five participants used search to find content that was not visible on the homepage. What is the actual opportunity size of this behavior in search logs?
• We need to reach out to a specific and unique audience so we can send them a survey. Can you help us pull a list of eligible audience members that match particular behavioral criteria so the research operations function can contact them?

You’re excited about this opportunity because you will…
• Work alongside expert research leads to bring a unique data-driven perspective to product and business insight
• Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
• Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends
• Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing to validate your findings
• Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations

We’re excited about you because you have…
• A degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, or similar domain
• 3+ years of experience in analytics, data science, consulting, or related quantitative role. Experience working in a Research function is not required, but a nice to have.
• Experience working with funnel optimization, user segmentation, cohort analyses, time series analyses, regression models, etc
• Expertise with SQL queries, ETL, A/B Testing, and statistical analysis (e.g. hypothesis testing, experimentation, regressions) with statistical packages, such as Matlab, R, SAS or Python
• Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Chartio, Looker, Tableau)
• The insight to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
• A passion for solving user needs and pain points for all of our audiences
• The determination to initiate and lead tactical and strategic projects to completion in a scrappy, fast-paced, and dynamic environment

97,7,"Sr Scientist, Nucleic Acid Biochemistry",Arc Institute,"Palo Alto, CA",via Greenhouse,"About Arc Institute

The Arc Institute is a scientific institution that conducts curiosity-driven basic science and technology development to understand and treat complex human diseases. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Arc is an independent research organization founded on the belief that many important research programs will be enabled by new institutional models. Arc operates in... partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley.

While the prevailing university research model has yielded many tremendous successes, we believe in the importance of institutional experimentation as a way to make progress. These include:
• Funding: Arc will fully fund Core Investigator’s (PI’s) research groups, liberating scientists from the typical constraints of project-based external grants.
• Technology: Biomedical research has become increasingly dependent on complex tooling. Arc Technology Centers develop, optimize and deploy rapidly advancing experimental and computational technologies in collaboration with Core Investigators.
• Support: Arc aims to provide first-class support—operationally, financially and scientifically—that will enable scientists to pursue long-term high risk, high reward research that can meaningfully advance progress in disease cures, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and immune dysfunction.
• Culture: We believe that culture matters enormously in science and that excellence is difficult to sustain. We aim to create a culture that is focused on scientific curiosity, a deep commitment to truth, broad ambition, and selfless collaboration.

With $650M in committed funding, the vision in the first 2-3 years is to grow to a team of roughly 150 team members, with plans for further significant growth over the decade ahead.

The Hsu Lab and Konermann Lab at the Arc Institute (https://arcinstitute.org), UC Berkeley Bioengineering, and Stanford Biochemistry are seeking applications for a joint staff research scientist to be based at the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, CA, working in the areas of RNA-Protein Biochemistry and Structural Biology. Our groups draw from a palette of technologies including DNA and RNA-targeting CRISPR systems, single-cell genomics, pooled genetic screens including Perturb-seq, and high-throughput methods for protein engineering to tackle big questions in neurodegeneration, synthetic biology, gene & cell therapy, and beyond.

Some of our recent projects include:
• Discovery and development of RNA-targeting CRISPR systems and programmable correction of tau mis-splicing (Cell, 2018)
• Deep learning of Cas13 guide RNA activity from high-throughput gene essentiality screening (BioRxiv, 2021)
• Large-scale discovery of recombinases for integrating DNA into the human genome (BioRxiv, 2021)
• Systematic functional mapping of SARS-CoV-2 host factor networks, and discovery of mucin glycoproteins as an antiviral pathway for diverse respiratory viruses (accepted in Nature Genetics, 2022)

Ongoing projects in the lab include developing new computational methods to investigate the host-pathogen arms race, discovery and development of new genome editing technologies, high-throughput genetic screens, and applications in mammalian synthetic biology and brain disease modeling.

Compensation will be competitive with industry jobs relative to experience level and background.

In this position, the Senior Scientist will:
• Work as part of a fully funded team to functionally characterize and engineer genome editing effector molecules using biochemical, structural, and genomic approaches, and to conduct molecular optimization to create new genome engineering technologies
• Purify and characterize protein-nucleic acid complexes using functional biochemistry approaches
• Design new project directions in close collaboration with the PIs
• Lead key research projects while mentoring students and research assistants; provide guidance on project strategy, experimental design, data analysis, and troubleshooting
• Keep up-to-date on advances in the field by reading the literature and attending key conferences
• Develop and provide training to lab personnel as needed, develop standardized protocols for the labs
• Assist with preparing manuscripts, abstracts, presentations

Job Requirements:
• PhD degree and postdoctoral experience in a relevant life sciences or engineering field
• Specific expertise areas that would be an asset to this role include: protein and nucleic acid functional biochemistry, protein purification, cryo-EM, investigation of nucleic acid binding proteins, molecular or directed evolution, and protein engineering
• Outstanding written and verbal communication skills is required for research presentations, SOP development, and publications
• Experience and enthusiasm for mentoring research trainees
• The successful candidate will be an ambitious self-starter, be motivated to apply his/her skills to diverse projects and enjoy working in a collaborative and fast-paced team environment",,['Full-time'],{'schedule_type': 'Full-time'},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,feminine-coded,"This job ad uses more words that are stereotypically feminine than words that are stereotypically masculine.

132,2,Senior Associate Scientist/Scientist/ Senior Scientist- Mammalian...,Ginkgo Bioworks,"Boston, MA",via Lever,"Ginkgo’s mission is to make biology easier to engineer. We are constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world in order to answer the globe’s growing challenges in health, energy, food, materials, and more. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house automated foundry for designing and building new organisms. Today, our foundry is developing over 40 different organisms to make different... products across multiple industries.

Ginkgo is continuously crossing new frontiers of biological engineering and we have a record of delivering what was, until recently, thought impossible. Now, our expansion into mammalian cell engineering promises to push our boundaries even further, and so we’re looking for pioneering engineers to make Ginkgo’s new mammalian cell foundry a success.

While cell and gene therapies have seen remarkable success in the clinic, we are at the dawn of a new age in our ability to precisely control gene expression. We’re searching for an outstanding scientist to join our team to execute synthetic promoter discovery screens in mammalian cells. In particular, we are looking for people with experience using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange and other pooled screening techniques. In this role, you will bring your fluency with molecular biology techniques and mammalian cell culture to help optimize and execute RMCE experiments in the context of cell and gene therapy. To be successful in this role, you will think big and execute systematically. You will work closely with a cross-functional technical team to contribute to the optimization of selection strategies, design of barcoding strategies and analysis methods. You will put your organizational and communication muscles to work every day as you work closely with teams across Ginkgo. The level of the position is flexible depending on prior experience.
