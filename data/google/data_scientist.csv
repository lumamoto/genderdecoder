19,9,Data Scientist,Striveworks,"Austin, TX",via Greenhouse,"Transform Decisions

The world’s looked to data analytics to bridge the gap between floods of data and the struggle to use that data effectively to make timely, impactful decisions. Today, most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right” – models that were developed to generally, or too slowly, to be effective in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying... ModelOps with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code.

Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector to be their primary solution for managing model development, monitoring, and governance – and ensuring those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.

Striveworks’ Chariot Platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely, as you train, test, deploy, and use models, our lineage system enables you to track both the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources, but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a highly principled experience for data and model development, Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution over the top of a performant ModelOps platform.

21,1,Data Scientist,Striveworks,"Austin, TX",via Greenhouse,"Transform Decisions

The world’s looked to data analytics to bridge the gap between floods of data and the struggle to use that data effectively to make timely, impactful decisions. Today, most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right” – models that were developed to generally, or too slowly, to be effective in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying... ModelOps with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code.

Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector to be their primary solution for managing model development, monitoring, and governance – and ensuring those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.

Striveworks’ Chariot Platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely, as you train, test, deploy, and use models, our lineage system enables you to track both the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources, but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a highly principled experience for data and model development, Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution over the top of a performant ModelOps platform.

What we’re building and why we’re building it...

Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years we’ve grown from 0 to 17M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands.

It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the “you get to use our product!” cop-out. We’re talkin’ real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps.

Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. -- Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?

That’s why we’re building the world’s rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands.

Fetch Rewards is an equal employment opportunity employer.

The Role!

This is a challenging and high visibility position, responsible for creating these solutions as well as guiding technical direction.

You possess:
• Entrepreneurial and big-picture bend of mind for applications of machine learning in a consumer tech world
• A penchant for fast prototyping and deployment and ability to pivot quickly to pursue impactful solutions
• Curiosity and passion for solving new problems with creative approaches
• Ability to successfully collaborate with both business users and engineers in solution development, deployment, and maintenance
• Discipline to create well documented coding and analytics packets to ensure reusability and scalability as the team, partner coalition, and user base expands
• Master’s or PhD in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science or any other Quantitative field
• 2+ years of work experience in data science

Bonus points for:

• Familiarity with Big Data frameworks like Snowflake, Google Cloud, and AWS services
• Familiarity with Grafana or any other visualization tools
• Effective communication, ability to translate and explain technical issues to non-technical team members

This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.

We have spent the past few years building the foundations of a modern ad serving system, building features to help brand and performance advertisers find their audiences on Reddit and get high ROI on their ad spend.

• In addition, you will work side by side with a world-class org of Engineering, ML, Search, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Analytics practitioners who work together to create a variety of capabilities for Reddit to be more successful in its decision-making and product creation. In this process, you will be exposed to a variety of new techniques in experimentation, statistical frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.

What You’ll Do:
• Analyze conversations and behaviors across Reddit’s 10,000 interest-based communities, and convert them into insights and product recommendations.
• Understand Reddit advertising and help the company improve Ads Revenue while simultaneously improving ROAS (Return on Ads Spend) for advertisers.
• Conduct product/feature analyses, opportunity sizing, experimentation (A/B testing) and build dashboards/visualizations to assess product health.
• Organize data by designing table schemas, data pipelines, aggregations, alerts and general data infrastructure for the Ads Organization.
• Collaborate with various cross-functional stakeholders, including Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers and Data Warehouse Engineers to lead projects related to organizing and analyzing data.
• Be an integral part of the Data Org, leveraging and contributing to the vibrant knowledge base, shared across a community of world-class data experts.

You will partner closely with cross functional team members such as Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, etc. in utilizing data to drive product decision and strategy. In addition to strong analytical skills, you will have an interest in data quality and collaborating with engineers to ensure we have the data we need to assess product performance.

Reddit is continuing to grow our teams with the best talent. We’re completely remote friendly and will continue to be after the pandemic.

How You’ll Have Impact:

Advertising is Reddit’s primary business model and we have an ambitious goal to turn it into a massive business. Although several large digital ad platforms already exist, advertisers are being increasingly drawn to Reddit because of our passionate communities that drive action. This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.

We have spent the past few years building the foundations of a modern ad serving system, building features to help brand and performance advertisers find their audiences on Reddit and get high ROI on their ad spend. We’re now ready to build differentiated products on top of those foundations, utilizing data to drive the product decisions for both short term and long term bets.

As a data scientist on the ads data team you’ll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights, play with the large data from one of the largest websites, and help define the culture and frameworks for future team members. Reddit sits in a unique place, where there are still a lot of low hanging fruit opportunities that will immediately impact millions of users and thousands of advertisers.

What You’ll Learn:
• You will partner closely with our Ads Product and Engineering team, which is the core driver of revenue for the company. You’ll play a key role in developing Ads product strategy and experiments. You’ll play with petabytes of data full of user and advertiser interactions to develop a deeper understanding of Reddit’s ads ecosystem.
• In addition, you will work side by side with a world-class org of Engineering, ML, Search, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Analytics practitioners who work together to create a variety of capabilities for Reddit to be more successful in its decision-making and product creation. In this process, you will be exposed to a variety of new techniques in experimentation, statistical frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.

What You’ll Do:
• Analyze conversations and behaviors across Reddit’s 10,000 interest-based communities, and convert them into insights and product recommendations.
• Understand Reddit advertising and help the company improve Ads Revenue while simultaneously improving ROAS (Return on Ads Spend) for advertisers.
• Conduct product/feature analyses, opportunity sizing, experimentation (A/B testing) and build dashboards/visualizations to assess product health.
• Organize data by designing table schemas, data pipelines, aggregations, alerts and general data infrastructure for the Ads Organization.
• Collaborate with various cross-functional stakeholders, including Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers and Data Warehouse Engineers to lead projects related to organizing and analyzing data.
• Be an integral part of the Data Org, leveraging and contributing to the vibrant knowledge base, shared across a community of world-class data experts.

Who You Might Be:
• 2+ years of experience in data analytics or related quantitative role
• Demonstrated ability to influence and guide product strategy with data
• Demonstrated ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
• Desire to mentor other data scientists and share best practices to elevate the data science practice at Reddit
• Strong ability to communicate and discuss complex topics with technical & non-technical audiences
• Proficiency with relational database (e.g., SQL) and statistical analysis/programming languages (e.g., R / Python)

Context: The research study is academic within social science (education). The datasets are already available. Code is available for cleaning the datasets and creating the variables of interest. Some variables need to be created for the 2SLS and RD analysis... but shouldn't take too long given existing code. Reference from a research paper will be shared that shows the step by step approach for the 2SLS analysis. RD analysis can also be referenced from other research papers. Also need advice on robustness checks.

The tasks that are needed:

1. Review existing code, improve or clean up as needed.

2. Write code for a 2SLS analysis, similar to one in a research paper that will be shared.

3. Write code for a Regression Discontinuity analysis.

4. Conduct robustness checks to ensure validity of findings.

5. Provide guidance on how missing data was treated, weights were applied, and standard errors treated.

6. Transfer datasets to Stata. Submit all code in Stata 13.

Work shouldn't take too long for an experienced data scientist as code to clean datasets and manipulation of variables already complete. Work will be independent, meeting with me directly for guidance and reporting progress.
