Salary: $150,000+
Equity: 0.1-0.3%

🌏 About Heard
Heard's (https://joinheard.com/) mission is to help therapists with their businesses.

By helping them take care of all their business needs — accounting, taxes, bookkeeping & more, we create a world where therapists can focus on the thing they know best: helping their clients.

Unlike most small businesses, mental health providers lack the tools and systems needed to understand the ins and outs of their business. They're forced to work with a disparate array of expensive services or contractors to manage their finances, their taxes, their payroll, their savings and more. Not only is this outside their area of expertise — every hour spent wrangling finances or filling out forms is one less hour spent providing care.

Heard offers therapists bookkeeping, accounting, taxes, and payroll all in one easy-to-use platform.

Heard is growing incredibly fast. We launched in Jan 2021, and most recently raised our Series A in Feb of 2022. We have a clear, well-funded pathway to becoming an industry leading software services provider for independent mental health practitioners","['Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",{'schedule_type': 'Full-time'},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,,masculine-coded,"This job ad uses more words that are stereotypically masculine than words that are stereotypically feminine.

About Us

We started Vanta in 2017 as Equifax had lost every American’s social security number, Home Depot had leaked its customers’ credit card numbers to hackers, and Facebook admitted that it irresponsibly sent user data to third parties who tried to influence the US election. It was clear that security and privacy had become mainstream issues, and that we all increasingly relied on cloud services to store everything from our personal photos to our communications at work.

Vanta’s mission is to be the layer of trust on top of these services, and to secure the internet, increase trust in software companies, and keep consumer data safe.

We do this by building an automated head of security for technology companies, and we use that system to both help a company secure itself and to prove their security to others.

If we succeed in our mission, it should feel irresponsible for users to put data into a product that isn’t certified by Vanta, and irresponsible for companies to collect data without using Vanta to secure and monitor themselves","['Full-time', 'Health insurance', 'Dental insurance', 'Paid time off']",{'schedule_type': 'Full-time'},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,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT66rNvVkup2yZQi5oXJIrj-YlgAo5d7NUzL5SPBPc&s,feminine-coded,"This job ad uses more words that are stereotypically feminine than words that are stereotypically masculine.

53,3,Frontend Engineer,Retool,"San Francisco, CA",via Greenhouse,"WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:

Retool is both an interface used to build internal tools and the runtime for those apps. It's used simultaneously by technically-demanding engineers and productivity-focused end users. As you can imagine, it's critical that we build a performant, usable, and powerful front end...

As a front-end engineer at Retool, you’ll be building a platform that thousands of customers rely on to run their operations.

We have a small but mighty engineering team. We’ve done a lot with a little, but there’s much more work to be done to continue our fast-paced growth, we need to hire a world-class engineering team. You’ll help us get there by owning end-to-end projects, talking with customers, and ultimately supporting the growth of Retool (both the product and the business).

WHAT YOU'LL DO:

Front-end engineers at Retool collaborate closely with our design team to craft a product that delights our users. You will help extend the core functionality of our application editor, which requires both attention to detail and an understanding of performance implications. To keep Retool blazingly fast we may end up experimenting with Core React functionality, Web Workers and WebAssembly.

New features often start off as customer ideas. You’ll take those ideas and scope, build, test, document and ship them to production . Outside of customer feedback, you’ll also weigh in on our product roadmap which is set collaboratively by design and engineering.

You’ll be working primarily in React and Typescript with a Node.js backend.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH:

At Retool, we work cross-functionally with designers, customer engineers, and support engineers, as well as the marketing and sales teams. Engineers make a lot of product decisions and you’ll partner frequently with designers as you scope and build your projects. Everyone on our design team is comfortable both in Figma as well as code.

We're a hard-working, passionate bunch who are motivated by collaboration, strong results, and bringing the impact of Retool to our customers. When we’re in the office, we enjoy eating lunch (and occasionally dinner!) together, and swapping stories. But at the root of it all, we come together to show our customers and not-quite-yet customers how Retool can make them and their companies more efficient and successful.

If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!

THE SKILLSET YOU'll BRING:
• 5+ years experience in professional front-end development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups
• Significant experience working with Javascript/Typescript and React
• Previous experience working closely with designers, building flexible, composable libraries and components
• You sweat the important details and are passionate about maintainable, scalable CSS.
• Experience owning technically challenging and demanding cross-functional projects
• A record of identifying valuable projects, communicating the strategy for them, and executing on them autonomously
• A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building is a polished product meets their needs
• Habit of introspection and understanding what’s helped you be successful in the past
• Bonus points if you have experience in mentoring other team members","['Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",{'schedule_type': 'Full-time'},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,,feminine-coded,"This job ad uses more words that are stereotypically feminine than words that are stereotypically masculine.

83,3,Senior Software Engineer (Remote),Culdesac,Anywhere,via Built In,"Who We Are

Culdesac is a real estate and technology startup that builds cities for people, not cars. Our goal is to create the first car-free city in the US. We started by creating the first car-free neighborhood built from scratch in the US - Culdesac Tempe, a $200 million mixed-use neighborhood development for 1,000 residents opening in 2022. The neighborhood covers 17 acres and features 55... open space, shared courtyards, and abundant bookable spaces. Culdesac is the co-developer and tech-enabled property manager.

11 rules for buying an ebike. Ebikes are about to change the world. By Ryan Johnson (CEO & Founder)

We’re headquartered in Tempe, AZ and were founded in 2018. CEO Ryan Johnson was previously on the founding team of Opendoor. We raised a $30M Series A in January 2022. Our investors include top VCs like Khosla Ventures, Lennar (LenX), Founders Fund, Zigg Capital, Initialized Capital, Byers Capital, and Y Combinator.

The Role

Our resident and customer experience is at the heart of what we do at Culdesac. We build neighborhoods and communities that are people-centered and strive to have every aspect of the experience reflect this. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will have an outsized ability to shape the direction of the company in deploying high-quality customer and internal facing software.

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer that will contribute to a wide range of engineering strategy, teamwork, and execution as we deliver scalable systems and top-notch user experiences. This is an engineering position, not a management one. However, because our team is still relatively small, ""tech lead"" activities, such as leading technical decisions, implementation scoping, and mentorship, may fall under its umbrella. You should feel comfortable and excited to take those on as the need arises.

You will help build a seamless onboarding experience which gives residents a sense of the physical spaces they will be living in through an online check-in experience. You will connect mobility, delivery and payment APIs with our built environment to allow residents to seamlessly transition between their digital and physical needs. Our engineering team will focus on quality over quantity when developing internal services used to keep our residents safe as we can't be wrong, even once.

The Requirements

While the role described above represents what we are ideally looking for, we encourage you to apply even if your resume includes strengths and experiences that don’t match everything listed here.

Experience collaborating, often remotely, with product, business operations, and other areas of the company in the US to create and own Culdesac's technical roadmap.

Experience in leading, proactively unblocking, and collaborating extensively with other engineers.

Passion for excellence, diligence, shipping speed, and maintainability both on the team and in your own work. You advocate for best practices even when under pressure.

Institute technologies, processes, and tooling that increase the effectiveness of the entire engineering team.

Passion for cultivating buy-in when difficult decisions need to be made. Support other staff in assigned project-based work.

Prioritizes a lifestyle leveraging public transportation, micromobility, and other alternatives to private cars.

Locations

We work hard to create a first-class, remote-friendly environment. We have remote positions, with about half our team distributed across U.S, including California, Texas, Colorado, New York, as well as other states. We are headquartered in Tempe, AZ, and our office is located in the heart of downtown Tempe. We encourage employees to visit and work in our beautiful Tempe office and offer relocation assistance to those who’d like to move to Tempe.

Benefits & Perks

🏥 Benefits Package - Includes options for medical, dental, and vision.
🥚 Family Planning Benefits
🐣 Parental Leave - Up to 12 weeks paid time off for qualifying events.
🏦 401K Savings
🖥️ Work From Home Stipend - Up to $500 for equipment paid by the company.
🌎 Co-Working Stipend - $100 per month paid by Culdesac for space intended for work productivity directly related to Culdesac business (e.g., co-working space pass for the day). Remote employees only.
🚲 Mobility Stipend - Up to $500 to invest in employee micro-mobility setup (e.g., e-bike, e-scooter, micro-mobility accessories).
🛴 Car-Free Commuter Benefit - $400 per month paid by Culdesac. Tempe employees only.

Our Values

As sprawl became commonplace in our cities, we felt less connected to each other. We normalized hour-long commutes, even as private vehicle ownership became the largest source of carbon emission pollution. Our cities blend technology, real estate, and culture to reimagine our daily lives. Come help us make our residents happier, healthier, and more productive in the years they spend with us and the moments they spend together.

At Culdesac, we:

Work as a team
Be inclusive, drawing on the strengths of people who bring a different perspective.
Find ways to work together that overcome disciplinary and geographic separations.

Ship, including the last 10%
Be output oriented. Ship.
Our mission weaves us deep into people's lives. Respect that trusted relationship by seeing your work through to the end, including the last 10%.

Embrace the full-stack
We have a competitive advantage in operationally complex, capital-intensive work.
Tackling all the layers in the stack gives us an opportunity to deliver an exceptional user experience.
Always remember Rule #0: learn from those who have done it before.

Ask people for feedback
Only users know if we’re creating value for them.
We get better by observing behavior and asking others how we can improve.
Respect the limits of what we can know and plan. In the complex organism of a city, emergent behavior rules.

Design for humans
The messiness of human preferences and decision making is the rich soil where our product grows.
Human paradoxes and contradictions are our opportunity to create joy.

Next Steps

If you think Culdesac might be a good fit, we encourage you to apply! You have nothing to lose, and we'll respond to you within a week.

If we move forward, here's our typical process:

1. A 30-minute video call with a recruiter to understand your high-level background and cover logistics & expectations.
2. A 2-hour take-home assignment.
3. A ""virtual on-site"" final round! A typical interview panel covers:
a. A 45-minute technical interview with two Senior Software Engineers.
b. A 45-minute whiteboard challenge with a Senior Product Designer.
c. A 30-minute interview with a non-engineer leader.
4. A final 30-minute video call with our CEO overview of a list of company scenarios.

At each step, we leave time for you to ask us questions. We look forward to hearing from you!

102,2,Manufacturing Engineer,Heirloom,"San Francisco, CA",via Lever,"About Us
All across the world, from the azure pools of Turkey and Oman to the travertine terraces of Yellowstone, our planet quietly pulls carbon dioxide from the air and turns it to stone. For eons, Earth has relied on this process to balance its carbon cycle. What if it could be harnessed? What if we could do it faster, in larger quantities, and at a low enough cost to make it an effective tool in the fight against climate change?

At Heirloom, we are turning that into reality. We use the natural carbon capture properties of abundant minerals to pull CO2 from the air, and store it permanently underground. We come to work every day to slow climate change, and are united behind a single, common goal - to remove 1 billion tons of CO2 from the sky by 2035, and to not stop before we get there.

We bring together the precise recipe of science, technology, know-how, and strategy necessary to make low cost, high quality carbon removal a reality. If we’re successful, we will directly... mitigate climate change, build a world we can proudly hand over to our children and grandchildren, and catalyze an industry that will rival the largest the world has ever seen. If you want to change the planet, come join us.

Heirloom is committed to diversity and building an equitable and inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds and experiences. We believe wholeheartedly that building a diverse company is critical to Heirloom’s success.

This team develops tooling to tease out high-quality signals from all the noise and collaborates with analysts to detect unwanted behaviors, such as fraud and abuse, among others. Your work directly impacts the way millions of people, teams and businesses get things done.

Slack's API and web backend is built using PHP/Hack, and our backend services are written in Java and Go. We use Airflow, Presto, Hive and Spark to interact with our data infrastructure.

Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture-we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we seek to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

What you will be doing
• Implement insightful and forward-looking approaches that go beyond the direct team and tackle larger open-ended problems.
• Participate in the strategic development of methods, techniques, and evaluation criteria for projects and programs.
• Build and scale data systems that power batch and real-time data processing of hundreds of billions of records daily.
• Collaborate with Data and Backend Engineering teams as well as Core platform and Features teams to understand and contribute to product and feature development that may impact our security model.
• You'll partner with the Detection and Analysis team to collect requirements for new developments and understand their impact to customers.
• You'll provide implementations to expose useful data to internal and external partners.

What you should have
• Proficiency working with data technologies that power analytics (e.g. Airflow, Hive, Spark, Presto, Kafka, Pinot, MySQL or similar technologies).
• Deep understanding of data processing (relational, key/value, document, columnar, graph).
• Expertise in high-level programming languages. We write Python and Go here, but are interested in seeing where you shine. (Java, Scala, Rust or other modern languages should be suitable as well)
• Experience working in a security function or understanding of and interest in learning more about security engineering
• Skilled at crafting and building robust backend data services (distributed systems, concurrency models, microservices) that distill practical insights out of large amounts of data.
• Dedication to code quality, automation and operational excellence: unit/integration/data quality tests, scripts, workflows.
• You can lead technical architecture discussions and help drive technical decisions within your team.
• Strong communication. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
• Keen Collaboration Skills. Collaborating is core to how we operate and this excites you! To us, this means working with other teams in engineering, security, and customer success/experience to ensure we're not missing a beat as threats from baddies grow.
• Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field, or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience.
• At this level, 4-7 years of proven ability is a typical guidepost, but in no way a requirement.

Tread is a construction software company that is venture-backed, building the future of 4+ year technology that uses data and analytics to keep construction moving.

The team at Tread care about what we build, and about each other. We value open communication and respect each other's diverse opinions and ideas regardless of their title. As part of the team, you'll have full visibility and be encouraged to make a positive impact every day on our customer's pain points and enjoy seeing the results of your work. We work hard to create an environment where everyone can share their ideas because we know innovation happens with diverse perspectives.

You will have the opportunity to provide certainty and precision to the trillion dollar construction industry: a market that is currently underserved by technology. We’re building systems that can support entire cities across North America and the hundreds of thousands of contractors and subcontractors that work within... them.

Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. Think you have what it takes, but not sure you check every box? Apply to the role anyways. We’d love to talk and determine together whether you could be a great fit!

We believe that diverse teams perform better and that fostering an inclusive work environment is a key part of growing a successful team.

149,9,Senior Backend Engineer,Tia,"Nashville, TN",via Greenhouse,"Tia was born from the realization that the healthcare system is missing just that: a system enabling health & wellbeing. Tia is the answer to the dehumanizing experiences that women of all backgrounds face navigating the healthcare system. We are rethinking the model of healthcare from the ground up – really asking: what does it mean to have a relationship with your care provider? What does it... mean to think about your health every day? How can we get back to the basics and also leverage the cutting edge research in women’s preventive care? Tia is on a mission to define answers to these questions through building a whole new, distinctly female model of care.

We are on a mission to enable every female to achieve their own definition of optimal health through science-backed information, access to high-quality care, and community.

We opened our first clinic in 2019 in NYC, with more to follow in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco this year. Combining virtual and in-person visits, an unwavering commitment to care and accessibility, substantial growth capital and an incredible mission, Tia is poised for rapid growth over the coming years and is building out a world class team to support this expansion.

Tia is building a culture of excellence — in people, process and product. This is our northstar value;

What is excellence, exactly?

Excellence about constantly elevating yourself, it is the process of constantly striving to perform to the best of your abilities, and identifying your top potential through constant learning, experimentation and evolution. Excellence is not about achieving perfection, as that insinuates a pinnacle. Instead, in our terms, excellence is about the pursuit of constant improvement. We’re looking for people who want to go on that hard journey of constantly setting new personal records, and organizational records.

We practice excellence at Tia by demonstrating the following types of behaviors: We chose (and actively choose) excellence as Tia’s highest order value because it crystalizes into one word several behaviors that we hold dear, specifically:
• A drive to constantly improve through experimentation, reflection. and an insatiable growth mindset — said another way, we’re energized by the possibility of invention, innovation, and iteration
• Being present in and grateful for the journey — not just the goal line. Perfection is static. Excellence is a process (more on this important distinction below)
• Asking why, then why again — because accepting “this is just the way it is” is not good enough
• Grit & perseverance — a maker mentality that involves “rolling up your sleeves”, but also deep care for oneself and for others
• A commitment to uncovering talents to unlock “rock star” potential across every individual

Furthermore, excellence reflects the “bigness” and the “boldness” of Tia’s mission and vision — a world in which every woman can achieve optimal health, as defined by herself.

Said another way, Tia’s mission is NOT to make healthcare incrementally better for women. Instead, we’ve intentionally set out to create a fundamentally new paradigm for modern women’s healthcare that’s truly excellent. We believe that creating a company that operates in a culture of excellence will manifest in our product. Reaching this goal is not an overnight pursuit or a “one and done.” We have not and will not “get it right” with the first swing. Rather, this higher order goal is a moving target — one we have not and will not ever fully “achieve.” By design, we will never be “done” with this work, but instead, we will be continuously in pursuit of our mission. It is this continuous pursuit — the journey, not the finish line — that truly embodies excellence.
