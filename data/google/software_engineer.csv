We are able to grow rapidly by acquiring traditional wealth management firms and supercharging them with our software to make them dramatically more efficient and support more clients without adding additional headcount.

34,4,Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack) Discover,SigFig,United States,via AngelList,"Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack)

Location: US Remote...

We are SigFig. We empower everyone to achieve their life goals and ambitions with intuitive and customer centric financial solutions. It takes extraordinary people to disrupt decades of legacy financial practices to reimagine solutions to serve customers at scale.

We are committed to building impactful financial solutions that are accessible and affordable to everyone. Using a combination of design, data science, and technology, we help provide people with financial advice and guidance they need to achieve their life goals. Whether it’s through our direct to consumer or business to consumer products through partnerships with some of the world’s largest and most innovative financial institutions like Wells Fargo, UBS, and Citizens Bank, SigFig seeks to help consumers and institutions make better financial decisions.

We are guided by our core values: Customer Delight, Make It Happen, Through Thick & Thin, Think Big, and We Over Me. Read more about our core values and how we live them every day on our website here.

Headquartered in San Francisco, we also have amazing talent solving interesting problems across our offices in Calgary, Tucson, Singapore, and New Delhi. Come thrive at SigFig!

The Team – Discover:

Discover is one of the products in SigFig’s ecosystem and this is the team that is squarely focused on it. Think of Discover like a “digital financial doctor”. It helps consumers:solve existing financial problems, diagnose tougher ones, uncover non-obvious ones, proactively prevent issues before they even occur, and lastly refer to additional professionals when necessary.

If you’re thinking this is a lot, it is! That’s why we work in an empowered product model. The team consists of engineers, product designers, & product managers working as peers focused on driving outcomes. Our motto is “minimize outputs, maximize impact.”

By bringing engineering, design, & product management together we believe we have the best chance of finding solutions consumers love that work for our business. So if you’re an entrepreneurial spirit, prolific at your craft, and love the challenge of traversing large search spaces to solve difficult problems with innovative technology, this might be just the team for you.

The Opportunity: Principal Software Engineer

As a Principal Software Engineer, you’ll have two parallel responsibilities: discovery & development.

During ongoing discovery, you will form a “triad” with design & PM to brainstorm and prototype solutions to probe consumer problems. Because of your deep insights around enabling technologies, the triad will be able to imagine solutions they might not have thought possible or feasible without your help. As part of the triad, once you collect sufficient qualitative evidence that the prototype is something usable and something consumers would love, you will have a few days to jump in and check feasibility assumptions by quickly creating a prototype. Then, in collaboration with sales & marketing the triad will work to test viability in the market. While we can’t completely eliminate value, feasibility, usability, & viability risk without real market proof; the goal is to do our best to not do low ROI work that won’t benefit consumers nor our business.

In parallel, as part of continuous development, you’ll be responsible for taking experiences you validated in discovery and building them into production grade software the financial industry can reliably run their business on. Here, it’s expected you are familiar with world class quality, scalability, & performance best practices; are comfortable in state of the art cloud architecture & are a backend stack & frontend stacks chameleon when you need to be. Of course, this is a team effort so you’ll be partnering with other talented members of the team to deliver value to the market as quickly as possible in the form of production grade software.

How You’ll Make an Impact
• Discovery: working quickly as a triad to understand problems & discover solutions in a way only a truly empowered engineering, design, & PM triad could
• Delivery: no amount of incredible prototypes matter if consumers & partners can’t actually experience the power of what we provide through state of the art delivery techniques into production fast
• Technological Mastery: it takes real passion to stay on top of broad technological trends and to know when that expertise can be leveraged to solve problems in a way never imagined before
• Creativity & Collaboration: creativity is a poorly understood concept; but what we do know is when creative parts come together in a collaborative whole a form of magic can happen which can then be seen through customer & business results

Why We Value You
• Growth Mindset: You soak in the diverse perspective of those around you and bring a growth mindset everyday.
• Ego-Less: You believe we are all here to find the truth, not to validate our egos. You are a truth seeker. You debate to discover the truth, regardless where it comes from.
• Strong Opinions, Weakly Held: You change your mind without a flinch when you realize you are wrong. People not familiar with cognitive fallacies might find you inconsistent.
• Deep, Strategic Thinker: you know time to value is of essence so you’re not afraid to dive in and do a depth first search to solve a problem versus when it’s time well spent to zoom out and do a breadth first search.
• ROI Driven: You value truly understanding the consumer & business context so you can repeatedly put your top tier skills to use in high ROI ways to benefit the consumer & the business.
• Technological: You’ve developed such a deep mastery of software engineering that you see language & framework agnostic patterns you can quickly adapt in any context, allowing you to easily do what’s necessary.
• Dreamer & Realist: You oscillate between being a dreamer and a realist. That’s because you know vision is admirable but at times being practical is the best thing you can do to help those around you.

About Fringe

We built Fringe to give companies a better way to show love and care to their people. Why? Because we believe it’s the people who really matter.

Companies exist because of the products and services they offer, but we believe the people within them should come first. At Fringe, this is the way we live.

What does this practically look like? It means we hire people who care about their teammates just as much as (if not more than) themselves. We hire people who are genuine, humble, willing to learn, ready to teach, able to adapt, flex, collaborate, celebrate each other, win together and lose together.

We’re a startup, and that means we must be a courageous group. We solve problems all day, but we also mess up sometimes. We extend grace to each other, and we try again. We aren’t looking for perfect people. We’re looking for people who own their faults, play to their strengths, and have the courage to simply be the same person all the time.

If that doesn’t sound like your cup of cold brew, no hard feelings. But that’s exactly who we are and what you can expect when you work at Fringe.

88,8,"Software Engineer, Collaborative Coding",Replit,Anywhere,via Jobs,"About Replit
We're focusing on: building the world's most ubiquitous programming environment; inspiring creativity and generating value for creators through community; and designing simple yet scalable infrastructure primitives for the next generation of creators. We want to blur the line between learning and making– a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and... launch a business all in the same day.

About the role

We’re looking for a talented software engineer to build the next generation of collaborative coding tools. You'll be responsible for our real-time and asynchronous collaboration experiences. This role presents interesting challenges from distributed systems to developer experience design. The problems are hard and stimulating as we are trying to re-imagine how people traditionally collaborate (i.e. async via git). Replit bundles runtime environments next to the code, and the infrastructure multiplayer-first so this is a unique space for version control.

This is a specialized and we are looking for people with experience in this area. If you are a generalist or specialize in another area, please look into other roles.

You will…
• Design and implement a protocol for our collaborative experience.
• Research and develop new paradigms for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.
• Work on a version control system built on top of the collaboration infrastructure.
• Enable teams at Replit to build features like code threads.
• Ship features and build infrastructure using: Go, Rust, and/or TypeScript.

You are…
• Experienced with collaborative technologies such as Operational Transforms, CRDT, or other multiplayer algorithms.
• Someone who values simplicity and pragmatism (you think radically but ship incrementally).
• Self-directed and comfortable working autonomously.
• Enjoys building infrastructure for other developers to build on top of.

Bonus Points
• Experience working with IDEs, terminals, or other common developer tools.
• Experience working with large distributed systems.

To achieve our mission of making programming more accessible around the world, we need our team to be representative of the world. We welcome your unique perspective and experiences in shaping this product. We encourage people from all kinds of backgrounds to apply, including and especially candidates from underrepresented and non-traditional backgrounds.

We are K1X. Our technology is used by the nation’s largest institutional investors, funds, and accounting firms, by bringing long- established solutions that are creating an all-digital K-1 experience. Our goal is to transform the K-1 industry by moving a traditionally analog based-process to an all-digital experience via our software solutions. Join us at the start of something... exciting!

Your Role:

As a Data Scientist on the K1X Team, you execute the technical vision for the data science components of the K1X Suite of Solutions by developing features, improving processing capabilities, and driving software engineering efforts.

Your Responsibilities:
• Develop new features that expand the extraction and processing capabilities of K-1 Reader.
• Update existing features of K-1 Reader to account for changes in tax forms and requirements.
• Collaborate with K1X technology team members to maintain and improve production infrastructure.
• Work with the Technical Lead to define the technical vision of the product and identify paths to deliver value.

Who you are:
• Additional experience in areas such as cloud computing, distributed systems, CI/CD, etc.
• Familiarity with agile software development practices and scrum ceremonies.
• “Hackiness” – you like to code and have interest in learning new technologies; you find it exciting to explore and/or improve libraries to help you solve a problem.
• You’re interested in machine learning and know a few things about learning algorithms, data preprocessing strategies, or other areas of machine learning that can help create more integrated and robust software solution.
• Thrive in fast paced, high growth environment.

It's Truly a Match If You Have:
• Programming experience. This job requires you to write and review code; experience in Python is required.
• Software engineering experience. You enjoy software engineering and know your way around algorithm design and data structures; you are used to working in Linux-based systems and comfortable using Docker to develop and deliver RESTful APIs.Strong communication skills. You are comfortable adjusting how you discuss software engineering projects, from the technical details to high-level concepts, depending on your audience of software engineer teammates, data scientist collaborators, and non-technical business stakeholders.
• Adaptable. K1X problems will involve different areas of computer science and machine learning skills, sometimes within the same problem. You can context-shift depending on the problem and can adjust if new problems and/or requirements arise requiring rethinking the approach to solving a problem.
• Detail-oriented. You like to find edge cases and potential bugs in code, you go above and beyond developing use cases beyond the requested basics, and you are meticulous with following software engineering best practices, including writing maintainable code with clear documentation and comprehensive test cases.

Don’t meet every single requirement? We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

MORE ABOUT HOPPER

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the... company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

- Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

- The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

- According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

- Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

- The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

- Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

- Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.

The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ00z8LvFg44uerWMrnsjLQFX5_RoOzBndTq7vx&s=0,"['Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']",{'schedule_type': 'Full-time'},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,strongly feminine-coded,"This job ad uses more words that are stereotypically feminine than words that are stereotypically masculine.

124,4,Software Engineer,Sora,Anywhere,via Jobs,"Sora is seeking a mid-level software engineer to help us build the backend and frontend of our web application.

About Sora...

Sora’s mission is to empower people-focused teams to create exceptional employee experiences. These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.

We’re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We’re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously. Employee experience is in our DNA — we invest in processes that are inclusive and fair, and we invest in our long-term mental, physical, and emotional health.

Sora was founded in late 2018 and launched in 2020. We’ve fundraised from some of the best investors in the world and prioritize keeping a diverse group of investors and advisors.

Sora is committed to being a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.

Your team

We are a small and mighty team of engineers with a passion for helping People teams do their best work. We’re empathetic, scrappy, nimble, thoughtful and committed to excellence. We listen to our teammates when they raise ideas or concerns. We get to provide input that shapes which features we’ll prioritize as a company, and then we drive the planning, implementation, and release of those features.

We live all over the country and (outside of COVID) love to get together for board games, surfing, cooking, Mario Kart, and more :)

Your role

You're an engineer with a few years of experience who will be responsible for developing and shipping features and updates to Sora that move us closer to our company mission, bring joy to our customers, keep our product working smoothly for end users, and ensure we're a secure source of employee data for customers.

You’ll build infrastructure in our backend and optimize database queries, add integrations to our 3rd party integrations service (which already has over 1,000 3rd party CRUD methods!), build frontend functionality, and contribute to the foundation of our nascent engineering team. You’ll help us keep our code up-to-date with best practices, and be a champion for shipping well-tested and well-organized code.

You’ll be a driver for positive change to Sora's engineering culture, processes and technology. Importantly, you'll help shape the future of the engineering organization and culture of the entire company!

Experience in these areas is not required, but in case it’s interesting, the main pieces of our stack include:
• Node
• React
• Postgres
• Redis
• AWS

• $300/month Flexible Remote Work Stipend: These funds can be used towards a variety of remote work expenses.

• Parental leave: 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave to all parents (regardless of family formation) with the option to extend 1 additional month at reduced pay.
• In-person co-working weeks and retreats: 3 times a year we offer the opportunity for everyone to get together in-person in a different city in the US. Most recently, we brought folks to Chicago to co-work for a week and participate in fun activities in the evenings.
• Ginger or Headspace: Anyone enrolled in Sora's health insurance should have access to a choice of either Ginger OR Headspace through Blue Shield.
• Maven: Anyone enrolled in Sora's health insurance plans through Blue Shield should have access to Maven, an app that offers comprehensive care for everyone planning, starting, and raising a family.

We are a music health company that provides binaural music to health care professionals for use on their clients.

We would like a software developer to help us to:

1) Create an online signup page where potential users can signup for our programs, and stream our music to their devices.

2) Create another signup page that is similar to the above, BUT with a payment portal. We would like for this page to be installed on the websites of our clients and need it to make API calls to our site.

Eventually, we would like to turn these pages into a Mobile App that we can Whitelabel for our customers, so this project has the scope to turn into a full-time role in the future.

Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.

The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers.

Experience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.

We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Live affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin. Madison, a city surrounded by water, has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

High-impact software development jobs for smart people...

Code that saves lives.

As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 250 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.

The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.

Experience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.

We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Live affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States and home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin. Madison, a city surrounded by water, has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

More than just important work.

We offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Epic is an Equal Opportunity employer.

We're focusing on: building the world's most ubiquitous programming environment; inspiring creativity and generating value for creators through community; and designing simple yet scalable infrastructure primitives for the next generation of creators. We want to blur the line between learning and making– a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and... launch a business all in the same day.

At Replit, we want to turn the smartphone from a device primarily for mindless consumption into a tool for stimulating creation. We’re building a brand new native mobile app that gives people computing superpowers, from wherever they are in the world. Our app will empower learners, casual explorers, and experienced programmers alike. We’re looking for a generalist mobile engineer to join our remote team and help us bring our app to the world.

If you have shipped apps for Android or iOS (or both!) and can reach into other parts of the tech stack, we want to hear from you! In this role, you will shape our first native mobile app from the ground up. To make programming on small touchscreens fast & fun, and ultimately delightful, we will need to rethink how programs should be written and composed, and shared with others.

To achieve our mission of making programming more accessible around the world, we need our team to be representative of the world. We welcome your unique perspective and experiences in shaping this product. We encourage people from all kinds of backgrounds to apply, including and especially candidates from underrepresented and non-traditional backgrounds.
