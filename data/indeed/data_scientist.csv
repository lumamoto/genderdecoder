50,Data Scientist,Striveworks,"Austin, TX",via Greenhouse,"Transform Decisions

The world’s looked to data analytics to bridge the gap between floods of data and the struggle to use that data effectively to make timely, impactful decisions. Today, most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right” – models that were developed to generally, or too slowly, to be effective in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying... ModelOps with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code.

Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector to be their primary solution for managing model development, monitoring, and governance – and ensuring those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.

Striveworks’ Chariot Platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely, as you train, test, deploy, and use models, our lineage system enables you to track both the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources, but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a highly principled experience for data and model development, Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution over the top of a performant ModelOps platform.

The Role

As a Data Scientist at Striveworks you’ll be challenged—and trusted—on day one to be a core contributor to the projects and direction of the company.

We are building the world's largest in-home care system...

Healthcare is rapidly moving into the home, creating an enormous market opportunity that's growing daily as consumers increasingly demand more convenient healthcare options.

Technology is the engine that powers our foundation. It ensures we can reach massive scale and drives differentiation from any other healthcare company entering this space. We're using data to ensure patient safety and tailor the care to patients' specific needs which allows for better care delivery from patient onboarding, patient care, and post care follow-up.

We're a remote first org and our engineering team is spread out across the US, Mexico, and Ukraine. Our culture is focused on impact, accountability, and collaboration.

As a team, we share the goal of driving the company forward and transforming healthcare through the technology we build. We believe the only way we can accomplish our goal is together, and that our whole is greater than the sum of our parts. We collaborate closely across every function because we recognize that no individual function can solve the whole problem as well as we can when we all work together.

With our teammates spread out across different cities, we actively support each other and cultivate an environment where everyone is comfortable sharing ideas regardless of seniority or function, and where the best ideas consistently win. We know the positive feeling we get when we feel heard, and we reciprocate that deep engagement with others when they're talking or presenting so that we gain alignment and promote our collective actions.

Come join us on the journey to transform healthcare!

74,Senior Data Scientist / Data,LegalZoom,Anywhere,via Triplebyte,"About LegalZoom

We have a rich history delivering against our mission to Democratize Law. For two decades, we have reduced the barriers to access legal assistance for both consumers and small businesses. From Estate Planning to Business Formations to IP, we’ve helped more than four million customers through simple, intuitive questionnaires and access to attorneys when needed. In doing so we have... provided the protection and peace of mind that our customers need. While we’ve accomplished a great deal, we believe there is so much more we can do to innovate and deliver for our customers. We’re committed to making our services more valuable and easier to use than ever before and we believe we can continue to infuse expertise and confidence into all of our products and services.

Overview

The Data Science and Engineering team at LegalZoom helps us make measurably better decisions, faster. We do this through everything from shaping our marketing strategy to running experiments that let us know how well our strategy is performing. As a Senior Data Scientist on our Marketing Data Science team, you’ll tackle many of the existential questions facing our business. Questions such as which prospective customers should we target, how do we segment our customers & develop contact strategies that maximizes engagement and future revenue streams from key subscriber segments, and what should our pricing strategy be are all places where we are working to help make better decisions.

You will:

Perform descriptive and predictive analyses to form hypotheses about how we can grow the business through better marketing spend and sales operations
Influence LegalZoom leadership to pursue our hypotheses so that we better serve customers and grow our business
Design and run experiments to test our hypotheses, including the definition of metrics that will enable us to understand customer behavior
Interpret experiment results and use them to drive strategic and tactical recommendations for how to better reach our customers
Provide insights at scale through building pipelines and dashboards that share the metrics you’ve created to provide us a more complete view of our customers
Work closely with Marketing and Sales to help them better understand how to use data as well as form their own hypotheses so we can move faster
You have:

Intellectually Curious – You know that stones are put there to be turned over and are always trying to look at things in a different way. You can’t stop asking “why” until you get to the truth.
Sees the Big Picture but Sweats the Details – You never lose sight of why the work you're doing matters. At the same time, you know that the devil is in the details. When working with a new set of data for the first time, you trust but verify that data are correct and make sense. But above all, you always true back to the original question and make sure you’re making progress in answering it.
Speaks Up - Being right a lot is important but only if it leads to others taking action. You speak up - especially when it seems controversial to do so - because you know that we’re all trying to do the right thing and want the best ideas to win.
Technically Sound – Your code is easy to read and is correct. You know SQL really well and can probably write some Python or R. You can use visualization tools such as Tableau or Superset to produce straightforward visualizations that people can understand. Your colleagues like working with the things you’ve built because they’re thoughtfully designed and well-constructed.
Analytically Sound – Your use of data and analytical techniques is sound. You understand the statistical underpinnings of experimentation and can design robust experiments. You define metrics that capture relevant customer behaviors in a way that doesn’t mislead. The models you build get the most predictive power out of the data because you understand how the techniques, you’re using work and know-how to transform data so that those techniques are most effective. Sometimes you break the rules, but you know the rules and have a principled reason for why you are doing so.
Good Learner - There is far more out there to know than any one of us can know but if given a little time you can pick up whatever it is you need to know to do the job. You efficiently seek answers for yourself but also know when to ask for help.
Intentional – You know what your priorities are and why they are your priorities. When asked to help with something, you seek to understand why it is important and consider whether it makes sense to engage before saying yes.
Relevant Experience – You've done something like this before. Whether it be a previous role in data science and analytics or something where you had to demonstrate the above qualities, at the senior level we need you to have some prior experience. In some cases, this can come from your academic background which is probably something STEM or with a quantitative bent.
It is also worth noting that we are working remotely through at least 2021 and when we return to the office will have a hybrid working model. This role can be based out of our offices in Bay Area/ Glendale, CA and Austin, TX, remote in one of our hubs (Chicago, IL; Seattle, WA; New York City Metro Area, NY; and Atlanta, Georgia; and Dallas, TX), or fully remote from most US states.

If you have the above qualities and think it would be fun to work in an open and fast-moving environment in which we democratize law, then we look forward to receiving your application!
