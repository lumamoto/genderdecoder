10,"Software Engineer, Platform",Replit,Anywhere,via Jobs,"About Replit
We're focusing on: building the world's most ubiquitous programming environment; inspiring creativity and generating value for creators through community; and designing simple yet scalable infrastructure primitives for the next generation of creators. We want to blur the line between learning and making– a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and... launch a business all in the same day.

About the role

The platform team gives every Replit user a free computer in the cloud so they can learn and build. Your charter will be to give users more power in the cloud, make the system run faster across the globe, and save Replit a whole bunch of money along the way.

Examples of what you could do
• Rearchitect the whole platform without downtime by separating compute and storage.
• Leapfrog the Docker ecosystem by betting on Nix for building reproducible environments.
• Give users custom domain hosting in mere seconds with magic domain linking.
• Make authentication automatic with zero-click auth for repls.

You will…
• Distribute our compute globally to better serve the next billion software creators.
• Remove limitations of our filesystem so users can have all the storage they need.
• Build out new platform products so our users can build sophisticated applications.
• Save Replit money and power the business through clever cost optimizations.
• Develop Replt’s infrastructure using Go, Rust, GCP, and IaC tools like Terraform.

You are…
• Someone who values simplicity and pragmatism (you think radically but ship incrementally).
• Self-directed and comfortable working autonomously.
• Experienced in distributed systems and containerization

Bonus Points
• You have experience with the Nix ecosystem
• You like to play with Linux filesystems for fun
• You have optimized large scale distributed systems for performance and cost
• You have managed a public-facing project (you have launched projects with real users)

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer you'll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry Front End application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds - such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.

57,Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack) Discover,SigFig,United States,via AngelList,"Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack)

Location: US Remote...

We are SigFig. We empower everyone to achieve their life goals and ambitions with intuitive and customer centric financial solutions. It takes extraordinary people to disrupt decades of legacy financial practices to reimagine solutions to serve customers at scale.

We are committed to building impactful financial solutions that are accessible and affordable to everyone. Using a combination of design, data science, and technology, we help provide people with financial advice and guidance they need to achieve their life goals. Whether it’s through our direct to consumer or business to consumer products through partnerships with some of the world’s largest and most innovative financial institutions like Wells Fargo, UBS, and Citizens Bank, SigFig seeks to help consumers and institutions make better financial decisions.

We are guided by our core values: Customer Delight, Make It Happen, Through Thick & Thin, Think Big, and We Over Me. Read more about our core values and how we live them every day on our website here.

Headquartered in San Francisco, we also have amazing talent solving interesting problems across our offices in Calgary, Tucson, Singapore, and New Delhi. Come thrive at SigFig!

The Team – Discover:

Discover is one of the products in SigFig’s ecosystem and this is the team that is squarely focused on it. Think of Discover like a “digital financial doctor”. It helps consumers:solve existing financial problems, diagnose tougher ones, uncover non-obvious ones, proactively prevent issues before they even occur, and lastly refer to additional professionals when necessary.

If you’re thinking this is a lot, it is! That’s why we work in an empowered product model. The team consists of engineers, product designers, & product managers working as peers focused on driving outcomes. Our motto is “minimize outputs, maximize impact.”

By bringing engineering, design, & product management together we believe we have the best chance of finding solutions consumers love that work for our business. So if you’re an entrepreneurial spirit, prolific at your craft, and love the challenge of traversing large search spaces to solve difficult problems with innovative technology, this might be just the team for you.

The Opportunity: Principal Software Engineer

As a Principal Software Engineer, you’ll have two parallel responsibilities: discovery & development.

During ongoing discovery, you will form a “triad” with design & PM to brainstorm and prototype solutions to probe consumer problems. Because of your deep insights around enabling technologies, the triad will be able to imagine solutions they might not have thought possible or feasible without your help. As part of the triad, once you collect sufficient qualitative evidence that the prototype is something usable and something consumers would love, you will have a few days to jump in and check feasibility assumptions by quickly creating a prototype. Then, in collaboration with sales & marketing the triad will work to test viability in the market. While we can’t completely eliminate value, feasibility, usability, & viability risk without real market proof; the goal is to do our best to not do low ROI work that won’t benefit consumers nor our business.

In parallel, as part of continuous development, you’ll be responsible for taking experiences you validated in discovery and building them into production grade software the financial industry can reliably run their business on. Here, it’s expected you are familiar with world class quality, scalability, & performance best practices; are comfortable in state of the art cloud architecture & are a backend stack & frontend stacks chameleon when you need to be. Of course, this is a team effort so you’ll be partnering with other talented members of the team to deliver value to the market as quickly as possible in the form of production grade software.

How You’ll Make an Impact
• Discovery: working quickly as a triad to understand problems & discover solutions in a way only a truly empowered engineering, design, & PM triad could
• Delivery: no amount of incredible prototypes matter if consumers & partners can’t actually experience the power of what we provide through state of the art delivery techniques into production fast
• Technological Mastery: it takes real passion to stay on top of broad technological trends and to know when that expertise can be leveraged to solve problems in a way never imagined before
• Creativity & Collaboration: creativity is a poorly understood concept; but what we do know is when creative parts come together in a collaborative whole a form of magic can happen which can then be seen through customer & business results

Why We Value You
• Growth Mindset: You soak in the diverse perspective of those around you and bring a growth mindset everyday.
• Ego-Less: You believe we are all here to find the truth, not to validate our egos. You are a truth seeker. You debate to discover the truth, regardless where it comes from.
• Strong Opinions, Weakly Held: You change your mind without a flinch when you realize you are wrong. People not familiar with cognitive fallacies might find you inconsistent.
• Deep, Strategic Thinker: you know time to value is of essence so you’re not afraid to dive in and do a depth first search to solve a problem versus when it’s time well spent to zoom out and do a breadth first search.
• ROI Driven: You value truly understanding the consumer & business context so you can repeatedly put your top tier skills to use in high ROI ways to benefit the consumer & the business.
• Technological: You’ve developed such a deep mastery of software engineering that you see language & framework agnostic patterns you can quickly adapt in any context, allowing you to easily do what’s necessary.
• Dreamer & Realist: You oscillate between being a dreamer and a realist. That’s because you know vision is admirable but at times being practical is the best thing you can do to help those around you.

Ideal SigFigian for this Role
• ROI driven (e.g. past customer and/or business results)
• Great character, world class craftsmanship & technical competence
• 10+ years working as part of an empowered product team

Benefits & Perks
• Competitive Benefits Package
• Flexible PTO
• Nest Wealth Retirement Planning Program
• $1000 Yearly Wellness Benefit
• Employee Recognition Program
• And more!
• We’re currently only hiring in the following states: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New York ,New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin

59,"Software Engineer, Risk",Found,Anywhere,via LinkedIn,"About Found:

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. That’s where we come in...

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. We’re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking, because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.

We’re looking for kind, resourceful, and passionate people to join us in building the safety net for self-employment.

About this role:

Hi, I’m Aabhas and I’m the CTO here at Found. Thanks for your interest in Found. Our team is responsible for taking products from ideation to being used by tens of thousands of users every week. We’re responsible for everything from building the product, to technical operations (and everything in between such as getting better with outages, improving reliability, reducing tech debt…)

We are looking for our first Risk/Fraud focused Software Engineering hire. This role will be responsible for protecting Found and our users and businesses by detecting, mitigating, and resolving risks related to fraud and regulatory requirements. This role has been historically played by our CIO and our core banking platform team, but as the amount of money managed and moved on our platform grows, this role requires dedicated focus and a team to support innovative ways to combat everything from ACH fraud to stolen credentials.

Day to day, you will:
• Design, build and operate tooling to make detecting, mitigating, and resolving risk on our platform easier and faster for our risk operations teams.
• Develop customer risk profiles that can be used to make downstream customer decisions such as approving limit increases, approving sensitive account actions, etc.
• Bridge the gap between our risk operations, analytics, product, and engineering teams, helping inform the roadmap for combating risk at the company.
• Implement systems that provide delightful experiences for our customers without unneeded friction, while still being able to detect and deny fraudulent actors.
• Evaluate and implement third party vendors or platforms that can enrich our risk / fraud scoring, detection, and mitigation.

To thrive in this role, you have:
• Interest in working full-stack across multiple technical domains, including backend services, customer facing tools, and basic machine learning models.
• Experience building products end to end - from technical design to implementation and launch.
• 3+ years experience with cloud infrastructure (e.g. GCP, Azure, AWS)
• 3+ years experience writing clean and maintainable code (our codebases are in Ruby, React, Typescript, Terraform but we’re open to Go and Python as well).
• Practical experience working with fraud (account fraud, payments fraud and chargeback, check fraud, etc.)

You may also have:
• Experience working in financial technology / financial services companies.
• Prior experience with KYC / KYB or background check stacks.
• Experience with stream processing systems such as Flink, Beam, Dataflow, or similar technologies.
• Familiarity with practical challenges in ML systems such as feature extraction, training, and monitoring of models.

About You

Found is built by a team that comes from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, and we firmly believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are crucial to our success. As we grow, we’re searching for passionate and motivated team members who are excited to bring their skill set to the team and are ready to learn from others.

If you are looking for a role where you will have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution and great impact, we would love to hear from you!

61,"Software Engineer, Collaborative Coding",Replit,Anywhere,via Jobs,"About Replit
We're focusing on: building the world's most ubiquitous programming environment; inspiring creativity and generating value for creators through community; and designing simple yet scalable infrastructure primitives for the next generation of creators. We want to blur the line between learning and making– a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and... launch a business all in the same day.

About the role

We’re looking for a talented software engineer to build the next generation of collaborative coding tools. You'll be responsible for our real-time and asynchronous collaboration experiences. This role presents interesting challenges from distributed systems to developer experience design. The problems are hard and stimulating as we are trying to re-imagine how people traditionally collaborate (i.e. async via git). Replit bundles runtime environments next to the code, and the infrastructure multiplayer-first so this is a unique space for version control.

This is a specialized and we are looking for people with experience in this area. If you are a generalist or specialize in another area, please look into other roles.

You will…
• Design and implement a protocol for our collaborative experience.
• Research and develop new paradigms for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.
• Work on a version control system built on top of the collaboration infrastructure.
• Enable teams at Replit to build features like code threads.
• Ship features and build infrastructure using: Go, Rust, and/or TypeScript.

You are…
• Experienced with collaborative technologies such as Operational Transforms, CRDT, or other multiplayer algorithms.
• Someone who values simplicity and pragmatism (you think radically but ship incrementally).
• Self-directed and comfortable working autonomously.
• Enjoys building infrastructure for other developers to build on top of.

Bonus Points
• Experience working with IDEs, terminals, or other common developer tools.
• Experience working with large distributed systems.

To achieve our mission of making programming more accessible around the world, we need our team to be representative of the world.

About Fringe

We built Fringe to give companies a better way to show love and care to their people. Why? Because we believe it’s the people who really matter.

Companies exist because of the products and services they offer, but we believe the people within them should come first. At Fringe, this is the way we live.

What does this practically look like? It means we hire people who care about their teammates just as much as (if not more than) themselves. We hire people who are genuine, humble, willing to learn, ready to teach, able to adapt, flex, collaborate, celebrate each other, win together and lose together.

We’re a startup, and that means we must be a courageous group. We solve problems all day, but we also mess up sometimes. We extend grace to each other, and we try again. We aren’t looking for perfect people. We’re looking for people who own their faults, play to their strengths, and have the courage to simply be the same person all the time.

If that doesn’t sound like your cup of cold brew, no hard feelings. But that’s exactly who we are and what you can expect when you work at Fringe.

We launched our MVP in February. The Verge called it ""The Google Inbox successor I've been waiting for"". We got a ton of interest and are scrambling now to deliver the features, performance, and polish our users need.

We have an experienced team distributed across the US, with almost half of our team located in California.

• A high attention to detail - email is so heavily used that the polish of our apps is critical to our business
• Good technical communications skills, both verbal and written
• A willingness to work hard as part of a team and learn new things quickly
• An owner mentality - there's a lot to do, and we need folks who are excited to take the lead on projects

94,Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack) Discover,SigFig,United States,via AngelList,"Principal Software Engineer (Full Stack)

Location: US Remote...

We are SigFig. We empower everyone to achieve their life goals and ambitions with intuitive and customer centric financial solutions. It takes extraordinary people to disrupt decades of legacy financial practices to reimagine solutions to serve customers at scale.

We are committed to building impactful financial solutions that are accessible and affordable to everyone. Using a combination of design, data science, and technology, we help provide people with financial advice and guidance they need to achieve their life goals. Whether it’s through our direct to consumer or business to consumer products through partnerships with some of the world’s largest and most innovative financial institutions like Wells Fargo, UBS, and Citizens Bank, SigFig seeks to help consumers and institutions make better financial decisions.

We are guided by our core values: Customer Delight, Make It Happen, Through Thick & Thin, Think Big, and We Over Me. Read more about our core values and how we live them every day on our website here.

Headquartered in San Francisco, we also have amazing talent solving interesting problems across our offices in Calgary, Tucson, Singapore, and New Delhi. Come thrive at SigFig!

The Team – Discover:

Discover is one of the products in SigFig’s ecosystem and this is the team that is squarely focused on it. Think of Discover like a “digital financial doctor”. It helps consumers:solve existing financial problems, diagnose tougher ones, uncover non-obvious ones, proactively prevent issues before they even occur, and lastly refer to additional professionals when necessary.

If you’re thinking this is a lot, it is! That’s why we work in an empowered product model. The team consists of engineers, product designers, & product managers working as peers focused on driving outcomes. Our motto is “minimize outputs, maximize impact.”

By bringing engineering, design, & product management together we believe we have the best chance of finding solutions consumers love that work for our business. So if you’re an entrepreneurial spirit, prolific at your craft, and love the challenge of traversing large search spaces to solve difficult problems with innovative technology, this might be just the team for you.

The Opportunity: Principal Software Engineer

As a Principal Software Engineer, you’ll have two parallel responsibilities: discovery & development.

During ongoing discovery, you will form a “triad” with design & PM to brainstorm and prototype solutions to probe consumer problems. Because of your deep insights around enabling technologies, the triad will be able to imagine solutions they might not have thought possible or feasible without your help. As part of the triad, once you collect sufficient qualitative evidence that the prototype is something usable and something consumers would love, you will have a few days to jump in and check feasibility assumptions by quickly creating a prototype. Then, in collaboration with sales & marketing the triad will work to test viability in the market. While we can’t completely eliminate value, feasibility, usability, & viability risk without real market proof; the goal is to do our best to not do low ROI work that won’t benefit consumers nor our business.

In parallel, as part of continuous development, you’ll be responsible for taking experiences you validated in discovery and building them into production grade software the financial industry can reliably run their business on. Here, it’s expected you are familiar with world class quality, scalability, & performance best practices; are comfortable in state of the art cloud architecture & are a backend stack & frontend stacks chameleon when you need to be. Of course, this is a team effort so you’ll be partnering with other talented members of the team to deliver value to the market as quickly as possible in the form of production grade software.

How You’ll Make an Impact
• Discovery: working quickly as a triad to understand problems & discover solutions in a way only a truly empowered engineering, design, & PM triad could
• Delivery: no amount of incredible prototypes matter if consumers & partners can’t actually experience the power of what we provide through state of the art delivery techniques into production fast
• Technological Mastery: it takes real passion to stay on top of broad technological trends and to know when that expertise can be leveraged to solve problems in a way never imagined before
• Creativity & Collaboration: creativity is a poorly understood concept; but what we do know is when creative parts come together in a collaborative whole a form of magic can happen which can then be seen through customer & business results

Why We Value You
• Growth Mindset: You soak in the diverse perspective of those around you and bring a growth mindset everyday.
• Ego-Less: You believe we are all here to find the truth, not to validate our egos. You are a truth seeker. You debate to discover the truth, regardless where it comes from.
• Strong Opinions, Weakly Held: You change your mind without a flinch when you realize you are wrong. People not familiar with cognitive fallacies might find you inconsistent.
• Deep, Strategic Thinker: you know time to value is of essence so you’re not afraid to dive in and do a depth first search to solve a problem versus when it’s time well spent to zoom out and do a breadth first search.
• ROI Driven: You value truly understanding the consumer & business context so you can repeatedly put your top tier skills to use in high ROI ways to benefit the consumer & the business.
• Technological: You’ve developed such a deep mastery of software engineering that you see language & framework agnostic patterns you can quickly adapt in any context, allowing you to easily do what’s necessary.
• Dreamer & Realist: You oscillate between being a dreamer and a realist. That’s because you know vision is admirable but at times being practical is the best thing you can do to help those around you.

Ideal SigFigian for this Role
• ROI driven (e.g. past customer and/or business results)
• Great character, world class craftsmanship & technical competence
• 10+ years working as part of an empowered product team

Benefits & Perks
• Competitive Benefits Package
• Flexible PTO
• Nest Wealth Retirement Planning Program
• $1000 Yearly Wellness Benefit
• Employee Recognition Program
• And more!
