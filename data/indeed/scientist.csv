Research Scientist, Nursing and Patient Care Research, Operations and Practice – Relief, Day Shift.

Focus Areas: Clinical and Patient Care Research, Health Services & Health Equity Research; Biostatistics, Epidemiology & Implementation Science

About the Office of Research Patient Care Services (ORPCS)
The Office of Research in Stanford Health Care’s (SHC’s) Patient Care Services (ORPCS) conducts original research on patient care delivery and collaborates with Stanford School of Medicine researchers and SHC front-line staff on research aimed at improving patient outcomes by advancing the quality, experience, and equity of patient care. ORPCS’s 3 focus areas include: Nursing and Patient Care Services Research, Clinical Trial Facilitation, and Health Equity Research.

Nursing and Patient Care Services Research
ORPCS’s Nursing Research division focuses on investigating processes and outcomes of care delivered by front-line nurses and allied health professionals. Nurse and Research Scientists in ORPCS’s Nursing and Patient Care Services Research division help SHC front-line staff conduct research on patient care delivery and nursing practice issues identified by staff in the context of everyday patient care delivery. Nurse and Research Scientists actively guide staff on a variety of formal research practices ranging from problem definition to research design, execution, analysis, and dissemination. ORPCS’s Nursing Research division partners closely with SHC’s Nursing Excellence group to support continued professional education and advancement of front-line nursing as a critical component of SHC’s Magnet Program.

Clinical Trial Facilitation
ORPCS’s Clinical Trials division supports and facilitates sponsored clinical trials and other clinical research in partnership with Stanford University School of Medicine (SOM). The Clinical Trials division ensures nursing engagement in administrative oversight of clinical trial execution and protection of human subjects in clinical trials. Working in conjunction with a transdisciplinary team and hospital-wide stakeholders, the Clinical Trials team facilitates trial coordination across various Patient Care Services (PCS) departments and oversees execution of physician-led clinical trials and research studies originating at Stanford University’s School of Medicine. The Clinical Trials team provides trial oversight and direction involving various operational components including trial intake, review, and facilitation; study placement; staffing; training and education; budgeting and financial oversight; research integrity and patient safety; and general operational oversight.

Health Equity Research
ORPCS’s recently formed Health Equity Research division focuses on disparities-driven research with a central focus on deepening SHC’s understanding of disparities experienced by diverse racial and ethnic groups and other disproportionately impacted groups within SHC’s patient population and patient catchment areas. The Health Equity division follows a Health Equity Improvement framework that begins with Health Equity Research Scientists analyzing and visualizing health system and public data sources to reveal potential disparities in health outcomes across different racial, ethnic, and underserved subpopulations. Armed with evidence of existing disparities, Research Scientists conduct or facilitate research aimed at surfacing root causes for observed disparities, then leverage research findings and insight to inform design and implementation of tailored interventions to reduce observed disparities in measurable ways. Working synergistically with ORPCS’s Clinical Trials and Nursing and Patient Care Services Research divisions, the Health Equity division’s key focus areas include: (a) identifying and addressing health equity risks across the clinical trial life cycle with the goal of increasing diverse representation of racial and ethnic minorities in SHC clinical research, (b) identifying and addressing disparities in nurse-sensitive quality improvement, and (c) identifying and addressing health equity risks across Stanford Health Care with the goal of improving health care quality, patient-and-family experience and health outcomes.

A Brief Overview

77,"Sr Scientist, Protein Engineering and Biochemistry",Arc Institute,"Palo Alto, CA",via Greenhouse,"About Arc Institute

The Arc Institute is a new scientific institution that conducts curiosity-driven basic science and technology development to understand and treat complex human diseases. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Arc is an independent research organization founded on the belief that many important research programs will be enabled by new institutional models. Arc operates in... partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley.

While the prevailing university research model has yielded many tremendous successes, we believe in the importance of institutional experimentation as a way to make progress. These include:
• Funding: Arc will fully fund Core Investigator’s (PI’s) research groups, liberating scientists from the typical constraints of project-based external grants.
• Technology: Biomedical research has become increasingly dependent on complex tooling. Arc Technology Centers develop, optimize and deploy rapidly advancing experimental and computational technologies in collaboration with Core Investigators.
• Support: Arc aims to provide first-class support—operationally, financially and scientifically—that will enable scientists to pursue long-term high risk, high reward research that can meaningfully advance progress in disease cures, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and immune dysfunction.
• Culture: We believe that culture matters enormously in science and that excellence is difficult to sustain. We aim to create a culture that is focused on scientific curiosity, a deep commitment to truth, broad ambition, and selfless collaboration.

With $650M in committed funding, the vision in the first 2-3 years is to grow to a team of roughly 150 team members, with plans for further significant growth over the decade ahead.

Our groups draw from a palette of technologies including DNA and RNA-targeting CRISPR systems, single-cell genomics, pooled genetic screens including Perturb-seq, and high-throughput methods for protein engineering to tackle big questions in neurodegeneration, synthetic biology, gene & cell therapy, and beyond.

Some of our recent projects include:
• Discovery and development of RNA-targeting CRISPR systems and programmable correction of tau mis-splicing (Cell, 2018)
• Deep learning of Cas13 guide RNA activity from high-throughput gene essentiality screening (BioRxiv, 2021)
• Large-scale discovery of recombinases for integrating DNA into the human genome (BioRxiv, 2021)
• Systematic functional mapping of SARS-CoV-2 host factor networks, and discovery of mucin glycoproteins as an antiviral pathway for diverse respiratory viruses (accepted in Nature Genetics, 2022)

Ongoing projects in the lab include developing new computational methods to investigate the host-pathogen arms race, discovery and development of new genome editing technologies, high-throughput genetic screens, and applications in mammalian synthetic biology and brain disease modeling.

Compensation will be competitive with industry jobs relative to experience level and background.

In this position, the Senior Scientist will:
• Work as part of a fully funded team to functionally characterize genome editing effector molecules using biochemical, structure-function, and genomic approaches, and to conduct protein engineering and molecular optimization to create new genome engineering technologies
• Collaborate closely with the PIs on planning and executing scientific research projects

Who You Are...

🧮 You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques

👩‍💻 You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

📐 You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

🎨 You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

❄️ You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®️ You are intimately familiar with R and/or Python for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data.table vs dplyr.

🏳️‍🌈 You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

🧑‍🏫 You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep, and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

🚜 You love crypto, NFTs, and DeFi, and you are familiar with the underlying data structures. You know the difference between holding, staking, and yield farming, and have used Ethereum and other chains to do something other than buy and sell tokens.

What You'll Work on

In this role you will work directly with Flipside data scientists, as well as the internal analytics, product, and marketing teams. You’ll also collaborate with our 🤓est-in-web3 community on tools and other projects.
